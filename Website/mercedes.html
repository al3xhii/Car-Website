	<li><b>C-Class</b>: is a line of compact executive cars produced by Daimler AG.</li>
	<li>Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190(W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's lineup until the arrival of the A-Class in 1997.</li> 
	<li>The C-Class is built at Mercedes-Benz factories in Sindelfingen and Bremen, Germany as well as numerous satellite factories in other countries.</li>
	<li>The first C-Class (W202) sedan was produced on 1 June 1993, and the first of the second generation (W203) rolled off the assembly line on July 18, 2000.</li>
	<li>The most recent third generation (W204) was launched in 2007.</li>
</ul>

	<li><b>SLR</b>:The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren is a grand tourer car jointly developed by Mercedes-Benz and McLaren Automotive,built in Portsmouth and the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, Surrey, England and sold from 2003 to 2010.</li>
	<li>When it was developed, German manufacturer Mercedes-Benz owned 40 percent of the McLaren Group.</li>
	<li>Due to the automatic gear box, front mid-engined arrangement, and its driving characteristics, some commentators classify the SLR McLaren as a GT, whose rivals would be vehicles such as the Aston Martin DBS V12 and Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano.</li>
	<li>SLR stands for "Sport Leicht Rennsport" (Sport Light Racing).</li>
	<li>Mercedes-Benz stated that they would build 3,500 SLRs over seven years, with an annual production of 500 cars.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>CLS</b>:The Mercedes-Benz CLS is an executive-size sedan originally launched in 2004 and based on the W211 E-Class and was internally designated as the W219.</li> 
	<li>The second generation CLS-Class was introduced in September 2010 and production started in the beginning of 2011.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>SLK</b>:The SLK is a compact roadster manufactured by Mercedes-Benz in three generations; R170 launched in 1996, the R171 in 2004 and R172 in 2011.</li>
	<li>As one of the first modern retractable hardtop convertibles, the SLK followed the 1995 Mitsubishi 3000GT Spyder and preceded other retractable hardtops such as the Peugeot 206cc, Lexus SC, Pontiac G6 and the Chrysler Sebring.</li>
	<li>The SLK Vario-roof was first shown on the SLK II concept car at the 1994 Paris Motor Show.</li>
	<li>The car went on sale two years later in Europe, and in 1997 in the US. The SLK is built in Bremen, Germany.</li>
	<li>The designation SLK derives from the company's design mission to create a roadster that was at once sporty, light and short — in German: Sportlich, Leicht und Kurz.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Vintage Benz</b>:The Mercedes-Benz 300SL was the first iteration of the SL-Class grand tourer convertibles and fastest production car of its day.</li>
	<li>Internally numbered W198, it was introduced in 1954 as a two-seat sports car with distinctive gull-wing doors and later offered as an open roadster.</li>
	<li>Built by Daimler-Benz AG, the fuel-injected production model was based on the company's highly successful yet somewhat less powerful carbureted 1952 race car, the Mercedes-Benz 300SL (W194).</li>
	<li>The idea of a toned-down W194 tailored to affluent performance enthusiasts in the booming post-war American market was suggested by Max Hoffman.</li>
	<li>As such, it was introduced at the 1954 New York Auto Show rather than the Frankfurt or Geneva shows at which other Mercedes models made their debuts.</li>
	<li>The "300" in its name referred to its three litre engine displacement, and "SL" stood for "Sport Leicht" (Sport Light).</li>
</ul>
